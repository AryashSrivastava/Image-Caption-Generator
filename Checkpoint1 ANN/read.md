## In this checkpoint, I have tried to implement artificial Neural Network from Scratch.
## Solving the Multilayer Perceptron Problem
## we have also generated the training dataset using the random 3 slopes 
The framework consists of the following components:

### Input Layer:

Number of features: 2
### Hidden Layer 1:

Type: Linear Layer
Number of neurons: 6
Activation: None (Linear activation)
### Hidden Layer 2:

Type: Linear Layer
Number of neurons: 3
Activation: None (Linear activation)
### Output Layer:

Type: Softmax
Number of neurons: 3 (corresponding to the number of classes)
Activation: Softmax activation function
### Loss Function:

Type: Cross Entropy Loss
Training and Prediction:

Training is performed using gradient descent (GD).
Prediction is done using the trained model after convergence.
Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualization, optional)
